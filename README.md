# Ludosity-s-Steamworks-Wrapper
Example of my work at Ludosity, developing a managed C# wrapper for Valve's Steamworks API

If you want to use this plugin, you can find the necessary files in the bin directory, just follow the steps in Bin/Steamworks for Unity.pdf
Compiling the code will require access to valve's steamworks api, which I can not upload here.
